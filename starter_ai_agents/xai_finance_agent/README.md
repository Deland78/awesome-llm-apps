## ðŸ“Š Build a Multi-Agent Personal Finance Coach
Fully functional multi-agent app with step-by-step instructions (100% opensource)

The application follows a multi-agent coordination pattern typical of complex AI systems:

Data Collection: Users enter financial information (income, expenses, debts) through the Streamlit interface, either manually or via CSV upload.

Agent Chain Execution: The app uses SequentialAgent, a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents in the order they are specified in the list:

Budget Analysis Agent evaluates spending patterns and identifies areas for reduction

Savings Strategy Agent develops savings plans based on budget analysis

Debt Reduction Agent creates optimized debt payoff strategies using both analytical methods

State Management: Each agent stores its results in the shared session state, allowing subsequent agents to build upon prior analysis. This state-passing mechanism enables a coherent analysis pipeline without duplicating work.

Visualization: The application processes agent outputs into interactive visualizations using Plotly, making complex financial insights accessible and actionable.
